# Introduction

I put a lot of effort into leveling every crafting and gathering job in the game to their maximum, and then went ahead and melded my crafting and gathering sets to their absolute maximum because I'm a masochist. I hope to save people a lot of time and gil by documenting what I learned along the way.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback, feel free to contact me either in-game (Shion Tsuji on Diabolos) or on Discord (AStarAfar#0001). You're also more than welcome to submit a pull request with changes!

Most of all, I hope you find this guide helpful!

## How to Read This

I do my best to adhere to certain conventions when writing guides, in particular the following.

:::info
If you see text in a blue box, this is additional information or context that may or may not be useful.
:::

:::caution
If you see text in a yellow box or prefixed with a ⚠️, this is a warning that a particular option or course of action may cost you more gil or resources than you would otherwise commit for the same benefit.
:::

:::danger
If you see text in a red box or prefixed with a ⛔, this is a warning that a particular option or course of action will end in failure or the loss of significant resources with no benefit.
:::

If you see `something in monospace font`, it's referring to an item, buff, or the name of an ability.

```
If you see a block of text displayed like this,
it's the body of an in-game macro that you need to create.
Each consecutive command will be on its own line.
There is also a copy button for each macro block that will place the macro body on your clipboard, so that you can paste it right into the macro editor in-game.

I've limited macros to 14 lines, so that there's a free line in case you want to add a completion message/sound (/echo Finished! <se.##>) or if you need to add a Final Appraisal action.
```
