# Crafter Leveling Guide

This guide is intended to help Final Fantasy XIV players level their crafting jobs in a way that reduces the amount of gil that you need to spend to as small a quantity as possible.

I put a lot of effort into leveling every crafting and gathering job in the game to their maximum, and then went ahead and melded my crafting and gathering sets to their absolute maximum because I'm a masochist. I hope to save people a lot of time and gil by documenting what I learned along the way.

I hope you find this guide helpful!

The intent of this guide is to minimize how much gil you spend while leveling. The only way to be successful is if you have your gathering jobs levelled already and are willing to spend the time gathering materials instead of buying them.

If you don't have your gatherers levelled already, I STRONGLY recommend doing so before continuing with this guide.

A gatherer leveling guide is in the works!

## Why did I write this?

My initial motivation for this was when a fellow Free Company member was asking to have crafted a seat of high quality crafting gear... for a level 20 crafting job. Being a pentamelded omnicrafter and omnigatherer, I was immediately perplexed by the request. I therefore asked why this was needed. As it turns out, they were following a crafter leveling guide that was requiring some rather outlandish gear in order to follow.

I looked a little closer at the guide, and I realized that the guide was published by a group that also **sold gil for real money**. I noticed that all throughout the guide, they'd sprinkled ads for their gil-selling service. The intent seemed fairly obvious. You'd try to follow this guide, and in doing so, you'd completely wipe yourself out of gil. In a fit of desperation, you'd fork over your money for more gil so that you can keep going.

:::danger
I don't think I have to say this, but real-money trading (RMT) is in gross violation of the game's Terms of Service. DO NOT DO THIS. You WILL receive a permanent ban if you're caught.

I told them to close that guide and never follow it again.

> "Here, come with me, let's get you a basic set of vendor-bought level 20 crafting gear, and I'll show you to the Firmament."

While I was getting them settled in and on their way, I decided to write my own guide and maybe save someone else from getting swindled.

## Conventions

I do my best to adhere to certain conventions when writing guides, in particular the following.

:::info
If you see text in a blue box, this is additional information or context that may or may not be useful.
:::

:::caution
If you see text in a yellow box or prefixed with a ⚠️, this is a warning that a particular option or course of action may cost you more gil or resources than you would otherwise commit for the same benefit.
:::

:::danger
If you see text in a red box or prefixed with a ⛔, this is a warning that a particular option or course of action will end in failure or the loss of significant resources with no benefit.
:::

If you see `something in monospace font`, it's referring to an item, buff, or the name of an ability.

```
If you see a block of text displayed like this,
it's the body of an in-game macro that you need to create.
Each individual command will be on its own line.
```

:::tip
There is also a copy button for each macro block that will place the macro body on your clipboard, so that you can paste it right into the macro editor in-game.
:::

I've limited macros to 14 lines, so that there's a free line in case you want to add a completion message/sound (`/echo Finished! <se.##>`) or if you need to add a `Final Appraisal` action. (More on that later.)
